                            <p>Clustering is a popular data analysis technique to identify homogeneous groups of
                                objects based on the values of their attributes, used in many disciplines and
                                applications. This extended abstract of
                                our undergraduate thesis for obtaining the
                                engineer degree in informatics and systems, presents an approach based on the
                                Social Spider Optimization (SSO) algorithm for optimizing clusters of data, taking as metric the sum of euclidean distances. Other important algorithms of the
                                literature were implemented in order to
                                make comparisons: K-means algorithm,
                                and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for Clustering. Experiments were performed using 5 datasets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, each algorithm
                                was executed many times and then the following measures were calculated: mean,
                                median, minimum, and maximum values
                                of the results. These experiments showed
                                that the SSO algorithm outperforms the
                                K- means algorithm, and it has results
                                equally competitive as the GA. All these
                                results were confirmed by statistical tests
                                performed over the outputs of the algorithm.</p>

                            <p>Automatic trajectory processing has multiple applications, mainly due to the wide availability of the data. Trajectory data have a significant practical value, making possible the modeling of various problems such as surveillance and tracking devices, detect anomaly trajectories, identifying illegal and adverse activity. In this study, we show a comparative analysis of the performance of two descriptors to detect anomaly trajectories. We define Wavelet and Fourier transforms as trajectory descriptors to generate characteristics and subsequently detect anomalies. The experiments emphasize performance in the description in the coefficient feature space. For that, we used unsupervised learning, specifically clustering techniques, to generate subsets and identify which are irregular. The implications of the study demonstrate that it is possible to use descriptors in trajectories for automatic anomaly detection and the use of unsupervised learning methods that automatically segment the required information. The performance and comparative analysis of our study are demonstrated through experiments and a case study considering synthetic and real data sets that leave evidence of our contribution.</p>

                                The growth of cities and the mobility of their inhabitants often generate traffic jams. In order to diminish this problem, cities began to implement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), such as real-time control and monitoring of public transportation buses, smart traffic lights, mobile applications to inform passengers. ITS are a reliable source of data collection for further analysis. This research aims to perform a clustering analysis to detect traffic jams, for which the Parallel Social Spider Optimization (P-SSO) algorithm was used. The choice of the P-SSO algorithm was made based on the previous results where the P-SSO algorithm was compared with the K-means and Social Spider Optimization (SSO) algorithms to solve clustering problems. On the first stage of this research, the P-SSO algorithm was used to define traffic jam states. In the second stage, the P-SSO algorithm was used to detect traffic jam areas based on the geospatial data generated by public transport buses in Cusco-Perú. This clustering analysis was performed on the main streets of the city between June and August 2019. Further, an application was developed that allows to check graphically the clusters obtained.</p>

Over the last years, several datasets have been developed to model these interactions. However, available datasets do not cover near-accident scenarios that our dataset covers. We introduce I see you, a new vehicle-pedestrian interaction dataset that tackles the lack of trajectory data in near-accident scenarios using YOLOv5 and camera calibration methods. I see you consist of 170 near-accident occurrences in seven intersections in Cusco-Peru. This new dataset and pipeline code are available on GitHub.</p>

                            <p>The high availability of trajectory data in different fields makes it attractive to analyze and enhance its multiple practical applications. In particular, trajectory anomaly detection has a significant practical value, making it possible identifying trajectories that may indicate illegal and adverse activity in diverse areas such as surveillance, tracking devices, traffic, and people flow. This study presents a methodology to detect anomaly trajectories based on their morphology features. For that, we follow two stages: (1) comparative analysis of the performance of two descriptors to group similar trajectories, and (2) trajectory anomaly detection based on their similarities. We define Wavelet and Fourier transforms as trajectory descriptors to generate characteristics and subsequently detect anomalies. Our experiments emphasize the measure of the performance in the description of the coefficient feature space using unsupervised learning, specifically clustering techniques, to create subsets and identify irregular ones. The study's implications demonstrate that it is possible to use descriptors in trajectories for automatic anomaly detection and the use of unsupervised learning to segment required information. Our study's performance and comparative analysis have been demonstrated throughout multiple experiments. We present some quantitative results using synthetic data sets as well as qualitative analysis throughout two case studies considering real data sets that leave evidence of our contribution. </p>

Most of the building recognition methods use local and global handcrafted image features and do not consider the rejection scenario, where the method have to be capable of identifying if a given image does not belong to any of the classes of interest. We propose a method based on convolutional neural networks that obtain effective feature vectors to perform accurate classification of buildings.

We use the alphabet of sign language of Peru (LSP). For this purpose, digital image processing techniques are used to eliminate or reduce noise, to improve the contrast under a variant illumination, to separate the hand from the background of the image and finally detect and cut the region containing the hand gesture. We use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify the 24 hand gestures. Two CNN architectures were developed with different amounts of layers and parameters per layer. The tests showed that the first CNN has an accuracy of 95.37% and the second CNN has an accuracy of 96.20% in terms of recognition of the 24 static hand gestures using the database developed. We compared the two architectures developed in accuracy level for each type of invariance presented in this paper. We compared the two architectures developed and usual techniques of machine learning in results of accuracy.</p>

                            <p>Hearing impaired people have the ability to communicate with their hands and interpret sign language (SL), but this builds a communication gap with normal people. There are models for SL recognition that have images sequence RGB as input; however, the movements of the body in 3D space is necessary to consider due to the complexity of the gestures. We built a model for Peruvian sign language recognition (PSL) to Spanish composed by 4 phases; first, the preprocessing phase in charge to process RGB, depth and skeleton streams obtained through the Kinect sensor v.1; second, the feature extraction which learn spatial information through 3 types of convolutional neural network (CNN); third, the bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM) with residual connections in charge to reduced and encode the information. Finally, a decoder with attention mechanism and maxout network which learn the temporal information. Our proposed model is evaluated in LSA64 and ourself-built dataset. The experimental results show significant improvement compared to other models evaluated in these dataset .</p>

                            <p>Center-based clustering is a set of clustering problems that require finding a single element, a center, to
                                represent an entire cluster. The algorithms that solve this type of problems are very efficient for clustering
                                large and high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we propose a similar heuristic used in Lloyd’s algorithm
                                to approximately solve (EMAX algorithm) a more robust variation of the k-means problem, namely the
                                EMAX problem. Also, a new center-based clustering algorithm (SSO-C) is proposed, which is based on a
                                swarm intelligence technique called Social Spider Optimization. This algorithm minimizes a multi-objective
                                optimization function defined as a weighted combination of the objective functions of the k-means and
                                EMAX problems. Also, an approximation algorithm for the discrete k-center problem is used as a local
                                search strategy for initializing the population. Results of the experiments showed that SSO-C algorithm is
                                suitable for finding maximum best values, however EMAX algorithm is better in finding median and mean
                                values.</p>

                            <p>The digital age came with an extraordinary ability to generate data across organizations, people, and devices, data that needs to be analyzed, processed and stored. A well-known technique for analyzing this kind of data is Clustering. Many bio-inspired algorithms were proposed for this problem such as the Social Spider Optimization (SSO). In this work, we propose parallel island models of the SSO algorithm for the Clustering problem, using 24 processors for each parallel algorithm. Such models were implemented using static and dynamic topologies, and datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository used for the stage of experiments. The achieved average speedups range from 15 to 28 times faster than the SSO algorithm for large and small datasets, respectively, and a parallel model with static ring topology performs a little bit faster than the other parallel models. The parallel algorithms provide results with similar precision to the ones computed with the SSO algorithm.</p>
